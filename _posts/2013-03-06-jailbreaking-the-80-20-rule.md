title: Jailbreaking The 80/20 Rule	
---
Apple plays by the 80/20 rule. Their products create great experiences for the 80% majority. The other 20% need to adjust.

iOS is great but not perfect. To see if I could improve the experience by tweaking that 20%, I Jailbroke my iPhone 5.

Jailbreaking often conjures up images of stealing software and illegal hacking. Really it's just a way to tweak iOS to your liking. It can be abused just like anything else.

So far I'm happy with the changes. Here are a few things I was able to do.

## Minimize Annoyances
- Hide Newsstand, Game Center, and Notes apps.
- Remove folder animations, and close folders automatically.
- Allow single tap clearing of notification center items.
- Set the default browser to Chrome.
- Set the default maps to Google Maps.

## Improve The UI
- [Cleaner status bar and better spacing](http://cloud.dankim.org/NKhT) - no battery icon, carrier name, am/pm or app names. Smaller icons, smaller toolbars, and five dock icons.
- [A richer app switcher](http://cloud.dankim.org/NMVM).

## Smart Shortcuts
- Detect when I'm home and disable passcode lock.
- Move multiple apps between screens.
- Triple tap home button to unlock.
- Open apps from the lock screen with gestures.
- Flashlight from notification center.
